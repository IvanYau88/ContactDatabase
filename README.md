# ContactDatabase
A database of REIT contacts

A database that stores all the REIT contacts that David has gained. 

Data comes from the source file where I had to do some cleaning. I cleaned the orignial excels to look for these column names: FIRM_ID	CONTACT_ID	INVESTOR	FIRM TYPE	TITLE	NAME	ALTERNATIVE NAME	ROLE	JOB TITLE	ASSET CLASS	EMAIL	TEL	CITY	STATE	COUNTRY/TERRITORY	ZIP CODE	LINKEDIN

Scripts is where you initilze the database.
